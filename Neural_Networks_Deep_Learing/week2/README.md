- [x] Logistic Regression as Neural Network
  - [x] Cost Function
  - [x] Gradient Descent
  - [x] Derivatives
- [x] Python & Vectorization
  - [x] Vectorization
  - [x] Broadcasting
  - [x] Programming Assignment (Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset)

### Results

- Train results: 99% accurate
- Test results: 70% accurate.

fine tunning is needed. Initializing the parameters with different weights. Having hidden layers may help to increase test results.
